# Data structures
I've created this repository to train and better understand basic data structures such as list, set, stack, etc. 

If particular data structure is also implemented in the native JavaScript I try to make my implementation's API as similar as possible.

Code in this repository is mainly **educational** and probably **should not be used in production**.

## Stack
- JavaScript (ES2015+)
- Jest

## Data structures
So far I've managed to cover:
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">Stack</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">Queue</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)">Set</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">Map</a>
