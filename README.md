# Data structures
I've created this repository to train and better understand basic data structures such as list, set, stack, etc. 

Code in this repository is mainly **educational** and probably **should not be used in production**.

## Stack
- JavaScript (ES2015+)
- Jest

## Data structures
So far I've managed to cover:
